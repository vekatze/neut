## Introducing Some Libraries

I've been enjoying this language by myself and have written several libraries:

- [ars-postgres](https://github.com/vekatze/ars-postgres) - A PostgreSQL client over libpq
- [binary-builder](https://github.com/vekatze/binary-builder) - Constructs binary data efficiently
- [dotenv](https://github.com/vekatze/dotenv-nt) - Locates and loads env files
- [http-base](https://github.com/vekatze/http-base-nt) - Provides basic HTTP entities
- [json](https://github.com/vekatze/json-nt) - Handles JSON values
- [noa](https://github.com/vekatze/noa) - A test kit emphasizing the property-based approach
- [path](https://github.com/vekatze/path-nt) - Provides path-related operations
- [rin](https://github.com/vekatze/rin) - An HTTP client over libcurl
- [sero](https://github.com/vekatze/sero) - Saves and loads values using files
- [socket](https://github.com/vekatze/socket-nt) - A thin layer over network sockets
- [text-builder](https://github.com/vekatze/text-builder) - Constructs texts efficiently
- [time](https://github.com/vekatze/time-nt) - Provides time-related operations

Hope you'll enjoy this too.
